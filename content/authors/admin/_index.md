Welcome to my personal page.

I am Niyazi Arslan, a third-year Ph.D. student in the Speech and Hearing Science program at Arizona State University. I am currently conducting research in the [`Auditory Implant Laboratory`](https://sites.google.com/site/asuailab/home) directed by [`Dr. Xin Luo`](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HdmRD9kAAAAJ&hl=en). I have a sincere interest in the technological applications of hearing science, in particular with [`cochlear implants`](https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/cochlear-implants). Making a positive impact on people with hearing loss is the source of my deep motivation for research in this field.
